    "In this puzzle you are challenged to draw a continuous line inside a grid in a way that your line pass one single time for each of the blank squares form the grid. To difficult your task, the grid has some holes that you can not pass or use in your way. This puzzle could be easily solved by hand and there is more than one solution. We wonder here weather this puzzle could be solved using MIP. What do you think? Of course it could! Let's get together to see how could we solve it.\n",

    "First, even before we start to show our formulation, keep in mind that we are gone solve a different problem. What? Calm down... Everything is going to be fine, sometimes we have to change our problem to better solve it. The problem is different but the solution will be the same. Ok, now that you calm yourself down, can I talk about the problem? Ok, thank you! So, instead thinking in drawing a continuous line trough the grid, we are going to think in put numbers on that same grid, in a way that for ever given number (except for the last one) its consecutive must be adjacent (up, down, left or right). Once we could put down this number it would be easy to draw a continuous line from them, don't you think? Me too. So, let's begin. \n",

    "### Input Data\n",
    "We begin by defining the characteristics of our grid:\n",
    "- Number of rows:  \n",
    "    `num_rows=6`\n",
    "- Number of Columns:  \n",
    "    `num_cols=6`  \n",
    "- The holes:  \n",
    "    `H = [(0, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 5)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information we are able to determine how many digits we are going to need to fill the grid. Is just to diminish the number of holes (9, in our case) from the size of the grid (6x6=36 in our case):\n",
    "`num_digits = num_rows*num_cols-len(H)`\n",
    "Note that we could just say that num_digits=36-9=27. However, if we do that, everytime we change the grid we are going to change also the digits number either, not nice, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we must define some lists to manipulate the problem. As we have defined num_rows and num_cols before, let's use them in that task:\n",
    "- rows indexes:  \n",
    "`I = [1, 2, 3, ..., num_rows]`\n",
    "- columns indexes:  \n",
    "`J = [1, 2, 3, ..., num_cols]`\n",
    "- digits indexes:\n",
    "`K = [1, 2, 3, ..., num_digits]`\n",
    "- valid cells\n",
    "`C= [(i,j) for i in I for j in J if (i, j) not in H]`\n",
    "Note that for build C, we just take out the holes (H) from de 6x6 grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "As every valid cell will receive one variable for each digit in K. Let's define a list of key ordered triples to help us to define the decision variables later:\n",
    "`keys = [(i, j, k) for i, j in C for k in K]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Variables\n",
    "There is one to be made: What digit goes in each valid cell?\n",
    "\n",
    "So we define one set of binary variables:\n",
    "- $x_{ijk}$ equals $1$ if digit $k$ goes in cell $(i, j)$, $0$ otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "Three constraints are required to model this puzzle.\n",
    "- Exactly one digit is assigned to each cell:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{\\displaystyle \\sum_{k \\in K}} x_{ijk} = 1, \\ \\ \\ \\ \\forall (i, j) \\in C\n",
    "$$\n",
    "As all of our variables are binary, we are forcing here that just one of those inside the sum would be 1. Let's make it clearer with an example. Consider the cell (2, 3). We hope that just one digit will be assigned to it, right?  \n",
    "So, cross your fingers and let's see how does our constraint works for that cell:  \n",
    "$x_{2,3,1} + x_{2,3,2} + x_{2,3,3} + \\cdots + x_{2,3,27} = 1$  \n",
    "All those variables are assigned to cell (2,3) and each one represent a different digit (the third index). So, if all that sum must be 1, it means that only one of them would be 1 and the others would be zero. In other words, only one digit will be assigned to cell (2,3), just the want it. Hi five!  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- All digits must be used only once:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{\\displaystyle \\sum_{(i, j) \\in C}} x_{ijk} = 1, \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\forall  k\\in K.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Here we use the strategy we use in the first constrain, but here we chose one digit and force it to appears one and only one time in all valid cells. If have trouble to understand this constraint you can chose a random digit and see what happens.    \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- every digit must has its consecutive in an adjacent cell\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "x_{i,j,k} \\leq  x_{i+1,j,k+1} + x_{i-1,j,k+1} + x_{i,j+1,k+1} + x_{i,j-1,k+1}, \\\\\n",
    "\\forall k \\in K, \\forall (i,j) \\in C.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Ok! That is the soul of the puzzle! Remember that we want to draw a continuous line, right? But, instead of draw it we are going to fill the grid with numbers and then draw the line following the track of the numbers. For this to work, the numbers must have to leave continuous track. It means that we must know where to go next once we start from the first number. That's what this constraint is about. It guarantees that the next number ($k+1$) is in a cell up $(i+1,j)$, down $(i-1,j)$, in the left $(i,j-1)$ or in the right $(i,j+1)$  of chosen cell $(i,j)$ with the number $k$. Example pleeeeease! You could ask it nicely, but ok, let's make an example... Consider the number $k=10$ and the cell $(2,3)$ again. The constraint will then be:  \n",
    "$x_{2,3,10} \\leq x_{3,3,11} + x_{1,3,11}+ x_{2,4,11}+x_{2,2,11}$  \n",
    "Here, we have two cases: the number $10$ could be or could not be in the cell $(2,3)$. If it is not, so $x_{2,3,10}$ would be zero and the left size could be 0 (if number 11 is in the neighborhood) or could be 1 (if 11 is far away). But if $10$ is, in fact, in cell $(2,3)$, and that is the case that matters, $x{2,3,10}$ would be $1$. The constraint will, then, force the right side to be 1 as well (note that the right side could not be more than one because of the first constraint). If the left side must be 1, it means that the number 11 must be in a cell adjacent to $(2,3)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obs.: Note that the cell (3,3) that appears in the right side of our example is a hole. When you code this part you have to take care of it, ok?\n",
